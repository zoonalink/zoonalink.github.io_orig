## Who

I am a Swedish national currently living in the United Kingdom.  I work full time for a Higher Education institution (University) and am also studying for a MSc in Data Science on a part-time basis.  

And I am really enjoying it!  

So much so that most of my free time is spent with my laptop at the moment...

I am currently:
* running less (although Covid-19 has a lot to answer for) 
* reading less (unless it is related to programming / Data Science / systems)
* spending less time with my family (although I am mostly in the same room)

As I regain health and motivation, and the weather brightens, I will most certainly rebalance where I spend my time.

## What

I came across GitHub pages by accident...but why not give them a go?

Initially I intend to use them to supplement the coursework elements of my studies.  

More aspirationally, I may post random EDA, list my technical CPD, write a blog, or work towards building a portfolio...

...all the while practicing Git, Markdown and other useful skills.



## Why

Let me be clear - I don't know what I am doing but I am hoping to learn by doing and practicing.  That's the 'why.'

Plus, my friends and colleagues will tell you that I can have a lot to say but all sorts of things.  Maybe I'll share.
