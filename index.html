<h2>Welcome my GitHub pages!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">This is my very first web page, so it is advisable to manage any expectations.</p>
<p>I am currently working fulltime within Higher Education in the UK whilst studying for a MSc in Data Science on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>The original purpose of this page (pages??) is to supplement the coursework assessment elements of my studies. Aspirationally, I can imagine posting my technical CPD courses, a regular blog (potentially about anything), and discrete programming projects...but that's a way off...and it is unclear, at the time of writing, whether I'll get there.</p>
